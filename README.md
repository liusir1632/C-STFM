## Introduction
A cross-temporal meteorological prediction model for multivariate forecasting


## Overview

* `openstl/api` contains an experiment runner.
* `openstl/core` contains core training plugins and metrics.
* `openstl/datasets` contains datasets and dataloaders.
* `openstl/methods/` contains training methods for various video prediction methods.
* `openstl/models/` contains the main network architectures of various video prediction methods.
* `openstl/modules/` contains network modules and layers.
* `tools/` contains the executable python files tools/train.py and tools/test.py with possible arguments for training, validating, and testing pipelines.

## Getting Started

An example of training SimVP+gSTA on 2m temperature dataset.
```shell
python main.py -d t2m -m SimVP --model_type gsta --lr 1e-3 --ex_name t2m_simvp_gsta


C-STFMï¼š
On the basis of successfully running simvp, change the /models/simvp.py file to the svp76.py file, keep the path consistent and run it. All changes to C-STFM are made in svp76.py.
